# Hello World with React boilerplate

Start coding a react application

> If you are working locally instead of using codespaces or gitpod, please follow [local installation steps].(#local-installation) and come back to this part of the readme.

## How to start coding?

- Install the packages with `$ npm install`.
- Run the webpack server with `$ npm run start`

You can update the `styles/index.css` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your, `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them.

## Local Installation (skip if you are working on codespaces or gitpod)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git
$ cd react-hello
```
